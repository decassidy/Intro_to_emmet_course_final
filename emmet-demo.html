		<!-- Type the above Emmet syntax below -->
		
		
		<!-- Elements
		
			You can use elements names like div or p to generate HTML tags. Emmet does not have a predefined set of
			available tag names, you can write any word and transform it into a tag:
			div → <div></div>, foo → <foo></foo> and so on. -->
		
		
		<!--Nesting operators
		
			Nesting operators are used to position abbreviation elements inside generated tree: whether it should be
			placed inside or near the context element. -->
			
		<!--Child: > (Greater than sign)
		
			You can use > operator to nest elements inside each other:
			div>ul>li
			Will output: -->
		
		
		
		<!--Sibling: + (Plus sign)
		
			Use + operator to place elements near each other, on the same level:
			div+p+b
			Will output: -->
		
		
		<!--Climb-up: ^ (carat sign)
		
			With > operator you’re descending the generated tree and positions of all sibling elements will be
			resolved against the deepest element:
			
			div+div>p>span+em
			
			...will be expanded to: -->
		
		
		<!-- With ^ operator, you can climb one level up the tree and change context where following elements
			 should appear:
			 
			 div+div>p>span+em^bq
			 
			 ...outputs to: -->
		
		
		<!-- You can use as many ^ operators as you like, each operator will move one level up:
		
			 div+div>p>span+em^^^bq
			 
			 ...will output to: -->
		
		
		<!-- Multiplication: *
		
		With * operator you can define how many elements should be outputted:
		
		ul>li*5
		
		...outputs to: -->
		
		
		<!--Grouping: ()
		
		Parentheses are used by Emmet's power users for grouping subtrees in complex abbreviations:
		
		div>(header>ul>li*2>a)+footer>p
		
		...outputs to: -->
		
		
		<!-- If you’re working with browser’s DOM, you may think of groups as Document Fragments: each group contains
		abbreviation subtree and all the following elements are inserted at the same level as the first element of
		group.

		You can nest groups inside each other and combine them with multiplication * operator:
		
		(div>dl>(dt+dd)*3)+footer>p

		...outputs to: -->
